                    <p>I'm a recent graduate from The Cooper Union with a B.S. in Engineering and a Computer Science minor. 
                        My academic journey ignited a passion for software development, machine learning, and data science. 
                        As a Breakthrough Tech AI fellow, I interned at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, achieved a top 
                        position in a Google Kaggle competition, and applied ML to real-world challenges under industry mentorship. 
                        Arising from my 6 month role as a STEM teaching assistant, I thrive in cross-functional teams and value clear
                        communication. Overall, I'm thrilled by projects that demand collaborative and data-driven solutions!

                        My role involved coding, fine-tuning, and optimizing 
                        the Python model to improve accuracy. The final image processing system was presented to industry professionals from MSKCC. </p>

                    <p> Worked with a partner to reproduce results from the paper “Adversarial Autoencoders” by Makhzani et al, which 
                        introduced a generative model for image synthesis. To implement the architecture, 
                        we created an adversarial autoencoder model using three basic model blocks: an encoder, decoder, and discriminator.
                        The model was trained, tuned, and tested on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 images. Finally,
                        we wrote a conference-style technical paper describing our research and experiments.

                    <h3>"Blob Bodies"</h3>
                    <p> In the entertainment industry, marker-based 3D tracking is a widely used method for
                        motion capture in video games and animated films. While highly accurate, it requires 
                        expensive proprietary equipment, is time consuming to set up, and is overall less accessible 
                        to everyday artists. As an alternative, pose estimation has gained popularity as a low-cost and 
                        open source method for body tracking. Therefore, this project investigated the application of Style Transfer 
                        to generate body tracking art in conjunction with Google's Blazepose and pose estimation algorithms.

                        cleaned, corrected, and merged. The final compiled data frame had almost 4,000 rows of crimes, and gave a bigger picture

                            mobility, and technology. We designed and coded an interactive installation in Java that tracks the body of a dancer 
                            and generates animations for the stage. By combining the Kinect camera with Processing, a visual graphics library, 
                            we achieved a beautiful end result. The fellowship culminated in an immersive exhibition in February 2023 and our

                            generated by a Python script that controlled the pen plotter’s movement. As the computer picked up noise from the environment, mathematical 
                            noise was added to the SVG drawing. We experimented with playing classical and rock music, and even singing!

                        <p>This interactive wall was based on the data scraped daily from 12 jail websites including inmates’ age, race, 
                            charge, and bond amounts. This interactive installation served to reveal the dual inequity of class and race in 
                            the American bail system and humanize those who are currently navigating this specific vein of the carceral state.

                        <p>As an AR/VR teaching assistant, my main role was to rapid prototype interactive apps in HTML and JavaScript. 
                            I mentored students in app development and user focused product design. Overall, I effectively managed 5 teams, 
                            providing guidance and troubleshooting for real-time VR and AR code. I completed a rigorous 25-hour training program to master 
                            the skills required for this TA position.

                        <p>I collaborated with 2 friends to fabricate an autonomous mobile robot for the annual Cooper Union Robot Battle. 
                            As the software lead, I developed a Python script that ran on a raspberry pi to parse real-time sensor data and define 
                            robot movement. This script also controlled speed and oriented the robot as it avoided obstacles. We summarized the robot’s
                             mechanical design, electrical systems, and assembly in a 100-page technical report, which can be accessed below!

                        <p>For this role, I supported the game design of Lost City of Mer, an award-winning cross-platform video game about climate change.
                             I collaborated with a team of software engineers, 3D animators, and writers to create game prototypes in Unreal Engine 4. My 
                             responsibilities included testing assets and character designs; I also conducted user interface research and presented findings 
                             at weekly meetings.”
